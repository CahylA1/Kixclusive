//FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS 

In the future I would like to build more life unto my project by adding more CSS and styling. 
Also I want to add features where you can view sneaker more into detail ( Ex: Zooming in , Spining around 
etc.) 
I want to get more familiar with Authorization and I want to have buyers and sellers be able to communicate with each other 
with a messanger option .
